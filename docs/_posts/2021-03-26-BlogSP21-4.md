Hi, this blog will talk about how to clone a repository from Github. Cloning a repository helps connect you to the repository and access your repository through your CLI. There is a way to clone your repository with SSH keys, but that requires you to have a certificate that is issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority. Another option, is also to use the Github CLI to clone the repository, as a UI friendly way of connecting to the repository. In this post, it will only demonstrate how to clone using HTTPS.
<br />
Cloning a repository:<br />
>1. Go to the main page of the repository on Github.<br />
2. Look for the green button that looks like a download icon and says "code" and click on it. <br />
3. As it lists the options on how to clone the repository, chose the one that mentions "Clone with HTTPS" and select the clipboard icon. <br />
4. Then open your Bash command line, and change the present working directory to a location where you want to play tour cloned directory. <br />
5. Next use the 'git clone' command followed by the link you coppied for cloning with HTTPS. <br />
6. Now you have a directory in your computer connected with your Github repository.
