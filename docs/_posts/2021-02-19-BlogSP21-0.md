2. A window will popup Windows Features and find the checkbox for Windows Subsystem for Linux, and check it. Hit OK.<br />
3. Your PC requires a restart after hitting OK, so restart PC.
4. Next go to the Microsoft Store from the Start menu, and search for Linux.
5. Find the Linux distro you want to install and install it.
6. Then you have it installed and you can run your environment and set it all up.
